	 * The span_seq lock is declared along with zone->lock because it is

	 * give them a chance of being in the same cacheline.
	 *
	 * Write access to present_pages at runtime should be protected by
	 * mem_hotplug_begin/end(). Any reader who can't tolerant drift of
	 * present_pages should get_online_mems() to get a stable value.
	 *
	 * Read access to managed_pages should be safe because it's unsigned
	 * long. Write access to zone->managed_pages and totalram_pages are
	 * protected by managed_page_count_lock at runtime. Idealy only
	 * adjust_managed_page_count() should be used instead of directly
