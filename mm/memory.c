/*
 * Ok, demand-loading was easy, shared pages a little bit tricker. Shared
 * pages started 02.12.91, seems to work. - Linus.
 *
 * Tested sharing by executing about 30 /bin/sh: under the old kernel it
 * would have taken more than the 6M I have free, but it worked well as
 * far as I could see.
 *
 * Also corrected some "invalidate()"s - I wasn't doing enough of them.

/*
 * Real VM (paging to/from disk) started 18.12.91. Much more work and
 * thought has to go into this. Oh, well..
 * 19.12.91  -  works, somewhat. Sometimes I get faults, don't know why.
 *		Found it. Everything seems to work now.
 * 20.12.91  -  Ok, making the swap-device changeable like the root.
